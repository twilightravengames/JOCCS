Imagine being able to access your music, documents, and videos from a browser anywhere you have internet
access.

Idea is to access your documents through a centralized server that caches your data as you access it,
forming a sort of hybrid cloud computing environment.


		LAN										LAN
client------------------------------------ internet --------- hybrid cloud computing server ---------- your media server
(can be an app on a mobile device,
a browser on a mobile device,
browser on another computer,
browser on a console gaming system,
etc..)


hybrid cloud server can also aggregate multiple media servers, allowing you have access to all of your data
on different computers at once
